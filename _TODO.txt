---- FRONT BURNER ----
Get rid of ExpressionNodeType.Nop no reason to exit. Return null and handle upstream in parser.

---- BACK BURNER ----

---- PLANNED ----

---- KNOWN ISSUES ----
Parserdoes not keep track of lines/columns within the text, and isnt sticking these to the language tokens yet.
    ^ Needs further investigation
ParsePrimaryExpression can through an exception if token is not what was expected. Channel into diagnostics, compare with upstream.

--- NOTES ---
Currently the pipeline is staged in 3 input parts, and 1 eval part.
    (1) Text (source code) is fed into the lexer, turned into language tokens.
    (2) LanguageTokens are taken by the parser to form expressions.
    (3) ExpressionNodes are taken by the binder to have types applied throughout the tree.

The evaluator then takes the bound tree and evaluates that.
