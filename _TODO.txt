---- FRONT BURNER ----

---- BACK BURNER ----
Move evaluator and parser to switch statements instead of pattern based. (JUmp tables are much faster and cheaper).

---- PLANNED ----

---- KNOWN ISSUES ----
Parser/Lexer does not keep track of lines/columns within the text, and isnt sticking these to the language tokens yet.
    ^ Needs further investigation
ParsePrimaryExpression can through an exception if token is not what was expected. Channel into diagnostics, compare with upstream.
