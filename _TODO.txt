---- BACK BURNER ----
Update evaluator to support more expression types

Parser/Lexer does not keep track of lines/columns within the text, and isnt sticking these to the language tokens yet.

ParsePrimaryExpression can through an exception if token is not what was expected. Channel into diagnostics, compare with upstream.
