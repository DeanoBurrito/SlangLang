---- FRONT BURNER ----
Get rid of ExpressionNodeType.Nop no reason to exit. Return null and handle upstream in parser.

---- BACK BURNER ----

---- PLANNED ----

---- KNOWN ISSUES ----
Parserdoes not keep track of lines/columns within the text, and isnt sticking these to the language tokens yet.
    ^ Needs further investigation
ParsePrimaryExpression can through an exception if token is not what was expected. Channel into diagnostics, compare with upstream.
